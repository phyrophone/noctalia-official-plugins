# Screen Recorder

Screen Recorder records the current screen with `gpu-screen-recorder`. It also
supports a replay buffer that can be started, stopped, and saved from the bar or
Control Center.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `noctalia/screen_recorder` |
| Version | `1.1.6` |
| Minimum Noctalia | `5.0.0` |
| Entries | Service: `service`; bar widget: `recorder`; shortcut: `toggle` |

## Requirements

Install `gpu-screen-recorder` on `PATH`, or install the Flatpak app
`com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder`. Portal capture also requires
`xdg-desktop-portal` and one supported backend, such as
`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`, `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland`,
`xdg-desktop-portal-gnome`, or `xdg-desktop-portal-kde`.

Recordings are saved to the configured output directory. When the directory is
empty, the plugin uses `~/Videos/Recordings`.

## Usage

The headless `service` owns recording and replay processes for the whole
session. The `recorder` bar widget and `toggle` Control Center shortcut mirror
the service state and send commands through shared plugin state.

Widget controls:

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Left click | Start or stop recording. |
| Right click | Start the replay buffer, stop a pending replay buffer, or save an active replay. |
| Middle click | Save an active replay buffer. |

Shortcut controls:

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Left click | Toggle recording. |
| Right click | Toggle the replay buffer. |

Replay controls are available only when `replay_enabled` is true.
